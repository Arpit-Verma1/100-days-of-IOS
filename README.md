## 📘 About This Repository

This repository started as a **100 Days of SwiftUI challenge** to build strong fundamentals through daily practice.

After ~50 days, I transitioned from isolated UI experiments to building **complete, production-style applications**, applying:

- Clean architecture (MVVM)
- Predictable state & data flow
- Gesture-driven UX
- Custom animations & interactions
- macOS & iOS-specific UI patterns

The repository intentionally contains **both**:
- 🧱 Foundation-level SwiftUI explorations  
- 🚀 Full-scale apps built on top of those foundations  

This reflects a **realistic growth path** from fundamentals to production work.


## 🧠 What This Repo Demonstrates

- Consistency through daily practice  
- Depth from UI components to complete apps  
- Strong UX thinking before coding  
- Ability to ship, document, and communicate work publicly  

This repository represents **how I approach building products**, not just features.
